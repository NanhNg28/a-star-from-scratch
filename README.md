implement A* from scratch
A* (pronounced "A-star") is a powerful graph traversal and pathfinding algorithm widely used in artificial intelligence and computer science. It is mainly used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, given the estimated cost of getting from the current node to the destination node.
